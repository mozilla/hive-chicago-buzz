      "The connected learning framework fosters participatory and hands-on learning; it empowers students to play, make, network, and innovate in the world around them. Schools and teachers are compelled to adopt this framework. They recognize that 21st Century learners need access to many new kinds of skills: digital media literacy, design thinking, and creative, hands-on explorations of science and technology."

      "Hive members are expert practitioners in developing and implementing youth programs. Typical skill sets include expertise in inquiry-based learning design, effective use of digital tools, youth recruitment and outreach and mentoring. However, according to initial feedback and discussions, Hive members may be less prepared to effectively collect, manage, analyze, and synthesize data about youth participation, outcomes and program effectiveness. We believe that the Think Tank group can help identify key solutions to help members more effectively use data to help reach Hive goals."
