      "In order to bridge connected learning innovations to the formal schooling environment, the Hive Teachers network will foster vibrant professional development (PD) opportunities for Chicago teachers–both on-line and face to face. Hive Teachers will be able to access PD experiences and tools that are connected to the Hive’s engaging program offerings, including “makerspaces” and digital media workshops. Using a participatory framework, Hive Teachers will innovate and spread new practices that are well-adapted for classroom facilitation and standards-based teaching."

      "The number of resources available to Hive members on evaluation, program planning, and grant opportunities is overwhelming. Program coordinators often struggle to find the right resource for the right project. Of the 3.5 million hits a simple Internet search on evaluation resources can pull, how can an already busy program coordinator find the best one? This is where Hive Think Tank can help. Through working with Hive member organizations and scouring recent literature for the best practices in data integration, we can help tackle the behemoth known as data and help Hive organizations succeed in building better experiences for our teens."

      "Successful Connected Learning environments link learning in school, home, and community, because learners achieve best when their learning is supported in multiple settings. In the Hive Chicago Community, our network’s strength is in the informal, out-of-school setting — we have an incredible ecosystem of programs for youth, from museums to after-school programs to community-based organizations, that recognizes learning when it happens anytime, anywhere. But what happens when youth leave our programs? How is their learning reinforced in school, or at home? Beyond their own personal interests and passions, what motivates youth to attend our programs? And how well is Hive supporting the Connected Learning that happens before youth reach us? How can we transform Chicago into a Connected Learning ecosystem, not just in our programs, but across all of the contexts in youth’s lives?
